photobiologyWavebands 0.1.0
===========================

Merge of photobiologyUV and photobiologyVIS packages.
Merged and updated the vignettes. Added functions for
calculating UV:PAR photon ratios. Added functions for
creating some coherent lists of wavbands (e.g. all ISO
defined colours).

********************
*  photobiologyUV  *
********************

photobiologyUV 0.2.8
====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyUV 0.2.7
====================

Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.2.6: wrong name used for wavebands created by UVC().
photobiologyUV 0.2.6
====================

Added "medical" definitions of UVB and UVB.

photobiologyUV 0.2.5
====================

Added "methane from pectin" BSWF of McLeod et al. (2008)

photobiologyUV 0.2.4
====================

Minor changes, with no effect on functionality

photobiologyUV 0.2.3
====================

Revised User Guide and added Catalogue of plot of BSWFs.
No changes to the R code.

photobiologyUV 0.2.2
====================

Added calculation of UV Index.

photobiologyUV 0.2.1
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.1)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.2.0
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.0)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.1.2
====================

Added vignettes. Still needs some cleaning of code and improved docummentation.

photobiologyUV 0.1.0
====================

First version. Implements equivalent WBs and SWFs to those
in UVcalc. The algorithms are exactly the same as most
of the functions were just copied from UVcalc 1.3.1

*********************
*  photobiologyVIS  *
*********************

photobiologyVIS 0.1.5
=====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.4
=====================

Added missing import directive. Rebuilt vignette under photobiology 0.2.16 as the output of the examples is cosmetically different.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.3
=====================

Changed waveband definitions to allow cacheing. A change in package photobiology adds hinges.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.2
=====================

Corrected error in green light wavelength range, and added new optional definitiions of wave length ranges.

Added a vignette: a manual.
