photobiologyWavebands 0.2.3
===========================

User Guide edited to match current versions of packages photobiology
and photobiologygg, as well as changes to the current of this package.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.2
===========================

Changed the definition of SWFs functions not to have any
intrinsic wavelength limitts, and made this limit
a new formal argument on the waveband constructor functions,
keeping the same defaults. Returned values
should remain unchanged. This bit of flexibility is needed
as different authors have used different limits
for the same BSWFs.

A new formulation for GPAS has been added. The formulation
by Micheletti and Piacentini (2002) is used for
example in the TUV model (version 5.0). The new waveband
contructor is GEN.M().

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.1
===========================

Changed the definition of SWFs to not include wavelengths
shorter than 280 nm, except for the case of UVR8 absorbance.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.0
===========================

Edits to User Guide for compatibility and rebuilt with photobiology 0.5.1, now required.

photobiologyWavebands 0.1.0
===========================

Merge of photobiologyUV and photobiologyVIS packages.
Merged and updated the vignettes. Added functions for
calculating UV:PAR photon ratios. Added functions for
creating some coherent lists of wavbands (e.g. all ISO
defined colours).

********************

photobiologyUV 0.2.8
====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyUV 0.2.7
====================

Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.2.6: wrong name used for wavebands created by UVC().
photobiologyUV 0.2.6
====================

Added "medical" definitions of UVB and UVB.

photobiologyUV 0.2.5
====================

Added "methane from pectin" BSWF of McLeod et al. (2008)

photobiologyUV 0.2.4
====================

Minor changes, with no effect on functionality

photobiologyUV 0.2.3
====================

Revised User Guide and added Catalogue of plot of BSWFs.
No changes to the R code.

photobiologyUV 0.2.2
====================

Added calculation of UV Index.

photobiologyUV 0.2.1
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.1)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.2.0
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.0)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.1.2
====================

Added vignettes. Still needs some cleaning of code and improved docummentation.

photobiologyUV 0.1.0
====================

First version. Implements equivalent WBs and SWFs to those
in UVcalc. The algorithms are exactly the same as most
of the functions were just copied from UVcalc 1.3.1

*********************
*  photobiologyVIS  *
*********************

photobiologyVIS 0.1.5
=====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.4
=====================

Added missing import directive. Rebuilt vignette under photobiology 0.2.16 as the output of the examples is cosmetically different.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.3
=====================

Changed waveband definitions to allow cacheing. A change in package photobiology adds hinges.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.2
=====================

Corrected error in green light wavelength range, and added new optional definitiions of wave length ranges.

Added a vignette: a manual.
