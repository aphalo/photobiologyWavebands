photobiologyWavebands 0.4.1
===========================

Update documentatiion.

photobiologyWavebands 0.4.0
===========================

Remove all definitions of ratios.
Remove vignette with plots of the wavebands.
Remove dependency of vignettes on package ggspectra.

photobiologyWavebands 0.3.4
===========================

Use package ggspectra instead of photobiologygg in vignette for compatibility
with ggplot2 version 2.

photobiologyWavebands 0.3.3
===========================

Minor correction of hinges in definitions to avoid errors at boundaries.

photobiologyWavebands 0.3.2
===========================

Added function and waveband constructor for ICNIRP BSWF.
Rebuilt data and package with photobiology 0.8.0.

photobiologyWavebands 0.3.1
===========================

R_FR_ratio() now uses "Smith10" giving 10 nm bands.

photobiologyWavebands 0.3.0
===========================

Rebuilt data and package with photobiology 0.6.0.
This required some minor edits to the vignettes.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.8
===========================

Edited the definitions of Red() and Far_red() to include additional
wavelength limits as used by other authors.

Updated User Guide.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.7
===========================

Some edits to vignettes.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.6
===========================

Added luminous efficiency functions for human vision, and the constants
used in the definition of Lumen.
Setlow's BSWF is now stored as a response.spct object using the same
variable names as in the rest of the suite.
The Setlow data from TUV has already been converted to energy units,
but this was not noticed when this data was added to the package. This
bug is now corrected.
Updated User Guide with some examples of the calculation of luminous
flux in lux from spectral irradiance data.
Added plots of the luminous efficiency curves to the Data Plots vignette.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.5
===========================

Updated vignettes.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.4
===========================

Update to documentation and vignettes.
UVR8-related data and functions moved to package photobiologyPlants.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.3
===========================

Now all contructors of waveband objects for BSWFs, have formal arguments
w.low and w.high, with values earlier in use, now set as defaults.

Added some references to the documentation.

User Guide edited to match current versions of packages photobiology
and photobiologygg, as well as to update to to the current version.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.2
===========================

Changed the definition of SWFs functions not to have any
intrinsic wavelength limitts, and made this limit
a new formal argument on the waveband constructor functions,
keeping the same defaults. Returned values
should remain unchanged. This bit of flexibility is needed
as different authors have used different limits
for the same BSWFs.

A new formulation for GPAS has been added. The formulation
by Micheletti and Piacentini (2002) is used for
example in the TUV model (version 5.0). The new waveband
contructor is GEN.M().

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.1
===========================

Changed the definition of SWFs to not include wavelengths
shorter than 280 nm, except for the case of UVR8 absorbance.

photobiologyWavebands 0.2.0
===========================

Edits to User Guide for compatibility and rebuilt with photobiology 0.5.1, now required.

photobiologyWavebands 0.1.0
===========================

Merge of photobiologyUV and photobiologyVIS packages.
Merged and updated the vignettes. Added functions for
calculating UV:PAR photon ratios. Added functions for
creating some coherent lists of wavbands (e.g. all ISO
defined colours).

********************
*  photobiologyUV  *
********************

photobiologyUV 0.2.8
====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyUV 0.2.7
====================

Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.2.6: wrong name used for wavebands created by UVC().
photobiologyUV 0.2.6
====================

Added "medical" definitions of UVB and UVB.

photobiologyUV 0.2.5
====================

Added "methane from pectin" BSWF of McLeod et al. (2008)

photobiologyUV 0.2.4
====================

Minor changes, with no effect on functionality

photobiologyUV 0.2.3
====================

Revised User Guide and added Catalogue of plot of BSWFs.
No changes to the R code.

photobiologyUV 0.2.2
====================

Added calculation of UV Index.

photobiologyUV 0.2.1
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.1)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.2.0
====================

Internally modified to work with photobiology (>= 0.2.0)
User interface unchanged.

photobiologyUV 0.1.2
====================

Added vignettes. Still needs some cleaning of code and improved docummentation.

photobiologyUV 0.1.0
====================

First version. Implements equivalent WBs and SWFs to those
in UVcalc. The algorithms are exactly the same as most
of the functions were just copied from UVcalc 1.3.1

*********************
*  photobiologyVIS  *
*********************

photobiologyVIS 0.1.5
=====================

Added setting of wb.label in functions defining wavebands.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.4
=====================

Added missing import directive. Rebuilt vignette under photobiology 0.2.16 as the output of the examples is cosmetically different.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.3
=====================

Changed waveband definitions to allow cacheing. A change in package photobiology adds hinges.

photobiologyVIS 0.1.2
=====================

Corrected error in green light wavelength range, and added new optional definitiions of wave length ranges.

Added a vignette: a manual.
