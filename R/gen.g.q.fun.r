#' Gives values for GPAS BSWF (Green's formulation) as a function of wavelength
#'
#' This function gives a set of numeric multipliers that can be used
#' as a weight to calculate effective doses and irradiances. The BSWF is normalized
#' at 280 nm.
#'
#' @param w.length numeric array of w.length (nm)
#'
#' @return a numeric array of the same length as \code{w.length} with values for the BSWF normalized
#' as in the original source.  The returned values are based on quantum effectiveness units.

#' @note In the original publication [2] describing the formulation, the long-end
#' wavelength boundary is specified as 313.3 nm. The equation
#' is coded here with no such limit so that any limit can be set when defining the
#' waveband. We do so because in some cases it is of interest to vary this limit
#' in sensitivity analyses.
#' The effect on the RAF and doses of changing this boundary is substantial, and
#' has been analysed by Micheletti et al. [3].
