Package photobiologyWavebands is a set of functions and date to be used together with package photobiology for calculating derived quantities from spectral irradiance data. The derived quantities are used to quantify the effect of radiation on different organisms or processes within organisms. These effects can range from damage to perception of informational light signals.

The defintions cover most unweighted wavebands in common use, and in addition some weighting functions used in the calcualtion of effective irradiances and exposures. The current version of the package puts emphasis on plant responses, but in the future it will be expanded to included responses relevant to other groups of organisms.
