\title{Constructor of far-red waveband}
\usage{
Far_red(std = "ISO")
}
\arguments{
\item{std}{a character string, defaults to "ISO", as for other colour
definitions, which in this case returns \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A waveband object defining a wavelength range.
}
\description{
Wavelength-range definitions for \emph{far-red} light according as
commonly used in plant or remote sensing applications.
}
\details{
The different arguments passed to formal parameter \code{std}
  determine the range of wavelengths set as boundaries of the returned
  \code{waveband} object; far-red in not defined by \code{"ISO"} standard
  definitions based on human colour vision, and included under red;
  \code{"Smith10"}, \code{"Smith20"}, \code{"Inada"}, \code{"Warrington"},
  \code{"Sellaro"} and \code{"Broad"} are non-standard but used in plant
  sciences; \code{"RedEdge40"} and \code{"RedEdge40"} are non-standard but
  frequently used in remote sensing.

  In plant photobiology the definitions proposed by Prof. Harry Smith are the
  most widely used, specially to compute a red to far-red photon ratio
  relevant to phytochrome photoreceptors. However, other authors have used
  different definitions in their publications. "Smith10" (725-735 nm),
  "Smith20" (720-740 nm), "Inada" (700-800 nm), "Warrington" (700-850 nm),
  and "Sellaro" (700-750 nm).

  Other definitions used in remote sensing. For example the "red edge" is to
  detect the condition of vegetation based on light reflectance by green
  vegetation. These bands are centred at the reflectance transition in the
  far-red band (725 nm), and here we define "RedEdge40" (705-745 nm) and
  "RedEdge20" (715-735 nm).
}
\note{
The bands are defined as square windows, these can be applied to
  spectral data to obtain the "true" values, but they do not simulate the
  sensitivity of broad-band sensors or the spectral transmittance of ionic
  filters. Some band-pass interference filters may have very sharp cut-in and
  cut-off, and their effect can be approximated by a square window, but
  filters based on light absorption will show gradual tails and bell-shaped
  wavelength-windows.
