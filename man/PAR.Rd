PAR(std = "PAR", norm = 550)

PhR()

PQYR(std = "McCree.field.mean", norm = 550)
}
\arguments{
\item{std}{a character string "Plant" (or "range"), "McCree" (or "photon",
"PAR"), "Zhen" (or "ePAR"), "Gabrielsen" (or "Gaastra" or "energy") or
"Nichiporovich", "McCree.field.mean" or "McCree.chamber.mean".}

\item{norm}{normalization wavelength (nm)}
}
\value{
For \code{PhR()}, a waveband object defining a wavelength range. For
  \code{PAR(std = "McCree")}, \code{ePAR()} and \code{PQYR()} a waveband
  object implementing different approximations of the action spectrum of
  photosynthesis in crop (land) plants as BSWF. In PAR() the BSWF is as
  defined by McCree (1972b), equal action per photon.  and thus including a
  weighting function used in computation of energy-base PAR irradiances. The
  weights are normalized to 1 at 550 nm. The waveband label is set to "PAR"
  or "PhR" accordingly.

\description{
Waveband definitions for \emph{photosynthetic radiation}
(PhR), \emph{photosynthetically active radiation}
(PAR = PPFD), \emph{extended photosynthetically active radiation}
(ePAR), \emph{phosynthesis quantum action spectrum weighted radiation}
(PQYR = YPD) according to different definitions in use for land plants.
}
\details{
Photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) as proposed by
  McCree (1972), and currently used in plant sciences, gives equal weight to
  photons within its range, thus weights increase with increasing wavelength
  when expressed as energy. PAR is normally expressed as photon irradiance or
  (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) using implicitly 1 as weight for
  all wavelengths. This is a simple photon-based Biological Spectral
  Weighting Function (BSWF). It is also possible, but very unusual, to
  express the quantity PAR as defined in McCree (1972b) as an \emph{energy}
  irradiance, in which case a BSWF with weights different from 1 needs to be
  used. In this case the default normalization wavelength for the PAR BSWF is
  set at 550 nm (at the center of the wavelength range). In some fields,
  such as meteorology, PAR is simply taken as a range of wavelengths used to
  integrate spectral energy irradiance. This is different to McCree's
  definition and in this package available under the name Photosynthetic
  Radiation (PhR). In the case of sunlight and using 550 nm for normalization
  the difference between the two is very small, while for artificial light
  sources the differences can be larger.

  Instead of using the simplified square-shapped BSWF as in PAR, some authors
  have used an photon-based action spectrum (or "quantum yield" spectrum) as
  BSWF and called the quantity \emph{Yield Flux Density} (YFD). A mean action
  spectrum from several crop species from McCree (1972a) is one of those that
  has been used in the literature. Here it is available under the name
  PQYR (Photosynthesis Quantum Yield Radiation) using two mean action
  spectra, for field-grown- and controlled-environment-chamber-grown crop
  plants.

  A recent proposal (see Zhen et al., 2021), defines extended
  photosynthetically active radiation (400-750 nm) (abbreviated as ePAR) as
  an alternative to PAR. The need to consider far-red photons as drivers of
  photosynthesis has become apparent with the increasing use of LEDs for
  plant cultivation. Far-red light contributes significantly to
  photosynthesis only when added to PAR. WARNING: the proposed definition of
  ePAR limits photon irradiance in the range 700-750 nm to a maximum of 30%
  of the total ePAR: ePAR is zero as long as PAR is zero, and never larger
  than 1.4 times PAR even in the presence of far-red photons in excess,
  because far-red photons have only a synergistic effect on photosynthesis
  driven by VIS light. Ensuring this condition is fulfilled remains the
  responsibility of the user of the wavebands returned by
  \code{PAR(std = "ePAR")}, \code{PAR(std = "Zhen")}, and \code{ePAR()} as
  FR's contribution can be assessed only by computing irradiances integrated
  for two wavelength ranges and comparing them.
  Function \code{xPAR_irrad()} from package 'photobiologyPlants' returns the
  constrained ePAR under the name of xPAR as well as ePAR and its PAR and FR
  components.

  Some earlier definitions, described by McCree (1972a), include Gabrielsen
  and Gaastra's, which used the same wavelength range as PAR but assuming
  wavelength-invariant response to energy. Thus, in this case weights
  decrease with increasing wavelength when expressed as photons. McCree
  (1972a) also cites Nichiporovich for a similar energy based quantity but
  covering a wider range of wavelengths (380-710 nm). Both of these
  definitions, even if mostly of historical interest, are also implemented.
  When used to compute photon irradiances the BSWFs are normalised at 550 nm.

  McCree's definition from 1972b is currently the one preferred by most
  researchers and used almost universally in the plant sciences.
  Photosynthetic radiation (400-700 nm) (PhR) is defined as a wavelength
  range and does not implement the spectral weighting inherent to McCree's
  (1972) of PAR or Gabrielsen and Gaastra definition of photosynthetic
  energy irradiance described by McCree (1972a).
}
\note{
\code{PAR()} and \code{PhR()} call the same function definition with
  different default arguments.

  The default for the normalization wavelength at 550 nm keeps the average
  weights across the waveband equal to unity, except the special case of
  ePAR, where the photons in the extension to the range act by synergy.

  Standard DIN 5031-10:2018-03 Defines two BSWFs \emph{sy1} and \emph{sy2}
  for photosynthesis. BSWF \emph{sy2} is not implemented but is based on the
  same data as \code{PQYR("McCree.field.mean")} with a specific
  interpolation. BSWF \emph{sy1} is not currently implemented in
  'photobiologyWavebands'.

\section{Warnings}{
 PAR is sometimes described as a range of wavelengths
  (e.g., Both et al., 2015), which can be confusing as there is more to
  McCree's (1972b) definition, a spectral weighting function by which all
  photons within the range of PAR elicit the same strength of response. As
  long as PAR is expressed as a photon irradiance it is identical to PhR.
  Similarly, as long as Gabrielsen and Gaastra's definition is expressed
  as energy irradiance, it is equivalent as using PhR.

  ePAR and PAR were designed to be use to quantify light sources with a broad
  spectrum, i.e., sources giving out white light or pale-coloured light. PAR
  and ePAR are technical measures of light useful for plants in the same way
  as illuminance is a measure of how bright light feels to an average human.
  None of them are meant to describe the response to be expected from an
  individual in particular, be it a plant or human. They are generalizations,
  that allow us to consistently measure light in different situations rather
  than directly predict the rate of photosynthesis. PQYR is similar in
  concept to PAR and ePAR as long as the same action spectrum is used
  consistently.
