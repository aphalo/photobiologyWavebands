\usage{
Red(std = "ISO")
}
\arguments{
\item{std}{a character string, one of "ISO", "Smith10", "Smith20", "Inada",
"Warrington", "Sellaro", "RS", "LandsatOLI", "LandsatTM", "LandsatETM",
"LandsatMSS", and "LandsatRBV".}
}
\value{
a waveband object defining a wavelength range.
}
\description{
Wavelength-range definitions for \emph{red} light according to ISO or as
commonly used in plant or remote sensing applications.
}
\details{
The different arguments passed to formal parameter \code{std}
  determine the range of wavelengths set as boundaries of the returned
  \code{waveband} object; \code{"ISO"} is an standardized
  definition based on human colour vision; \code{"Smith10"},
  \code{"Smith20"}, \code{"Inada"}, \code{"Warrington"}, \code{"Sellaro"} and
  \code{"Broad"} are non-standard but used in plant sciences; \code{"RS"} is
  non-standard but frequently used in remote sensing; the remaining
  definitions are for the published wavelength sensitivity range of imagers
  (cameras) in the Landsat satellite missions.

  In plant photobiology the definitions proposed by Prof. Harry Smith are the
  most widely used, specially to compute a red to far-red photon ratio
  relevant to phytochrome photoreceptors. However, other authors have used
  different definitions in their publications. "Smith10" (655-665 nm),
  "Smith20" (650-670 nm), "Inada" (600-700 nm), "Warrington" (625-675 nm),
  and "Sellaro" (620-680 nm).
}
\note{
The bands are defined as square windows, these can be applied to
  spectral data to obtain the "true" values, but they do not simulate the
  sensitivity of broad-band sensors or the spectral transmittance of ionic
  filters. Some band-pass interference filters may have very sharp cut-in and
  cut-off, and their effect can be approximated by a square window, but
  filters based on light absorption will show gradual tails and bell-shaped
  wavelength-windows. The Landsat instruments have very steep cut-in and
  cut-off slopes and are well approximated.
