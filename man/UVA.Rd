\title{Constructor of UV-A waveband}
\usage{
UVA(std = "ISO")

UVA1(std = "CIE")

UVA2(std = "CIE")

UVAsw(std = "plants")

UVAlw(std = "plants")

UVAsw(std = "plants")
}
\arguments{
\item{std}{a character string \code{"CIE"}, \code{"ISO"} or \code{"none"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{waveband} object wavelength defining a wavelength range.
}
\description{
UV-A according to CIE and ISO standards: 315-400 nm. UV-A according to
common non-standard practice: 320-400 nm. UV-A2 according to CIE report
134/1: 315-340 nm. UV-A1 according to CIE report 134/1: 340-400 nm. UV-Asw
according to non-standard use possibly suitable for plants: 315-350 nm.
UV-Alw according to non-standard use possibly suitable for plants: 350-400
nm.
}
\note{
The non-standard definitions of UV-A and UV-A2 using 320 nm as limit
  should not be used in any new publications or work as they deviate from the
  internationally recommended practice. Their continued use leads to confusion.
  Their inclusion in this package is to allow calculations needed to compare
  new results and methods against old publications. UV-A1 and UV-A2
  definitions are in use in medicine, but not yet standardised. Recent
  research on the plant photoreceptor UVR8 suggests that UV-A1 and UV-A2
  bands are also relevant to plants (Rai et al., 2021). UV-Alw and UV-Asw
  have been used for plants, but UV-A1 and UV-A2 seem now preferable.
