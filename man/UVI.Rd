\title{Calculate UVI from spectral irradiance}
\usage{
UVI(spct, std = "NOAA")
}
\arguments{
\item{spct}{a \code{source.spct} object}

\item{std}{"WWO" (250 nm to 400 nm), "NOAA" (286.5 nm to 400 nm)}
}
\value{
a numeric value for the unitless UVI (This is a value on a continuous scale,
rather than the discrete scale normally used.)
}
\description{
UVI (UV Index) is a unitless quantity based on erythema BSWF,
  that gives an easy to interpret UV measure, mainly meant for informing
  general public about sunburn risk.
}
\details{
Two different definitions of UV Index are implemented in this
  package. Setting std="NOAA" follows the definition in Kiedron et al. (2007)
  but using CIE98 as SWF. NOAA definition discards wavelengths shorter than
  286.5 nm as when calculated based on spectral data from Brewer instruments.
  "WMO" uses the internationally accepted lower limit at 250 nm (see WHO,
  2002). "NOAA" is the default as this is safer with noisy data for solar
  radiation measured at ground level, and in this case the value of UVI
  should be correct, and almost identical except for errors caused by noise
  at shorter wavelengths. However, when calculating UVI from radiation
  spectra from UV lamps, "WMO" should be used, as most UV lamps do emit some
  radiation between 250 nm and 286.5 nm.
